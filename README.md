## SSR
SSR configuration is super simple through [vite-ssr](https://github.com/frandiox/vite-ssr)([Examples](https://github.com/frandiox/vitesse-ssr-template)) or [vite-ssg](https://github.com/antfu/vite-ssg)

The project uses [https-localhost](https://github.com/daquinoaldo/https-localhost) for local PWA previews. Please follow the instructions outlined here to get up and running with it
