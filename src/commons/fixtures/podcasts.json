            "description": "The Unemployables Podcast is hosted by Chicago-based comedians Sean Ely, Corey Wagner and Zako Ryan, with new episodes every Monday morning everywhere podcasts are found.\n\nThe trio tackles viewer-submitted questions about sex, entrepreneurship, dating etiquette, foot fetishes, overcoming anxiety, butt stuff and ... OK, let's face it: There's a lot of questions about boning. Just being real.\n\nSean, Corey and Zako also dive into their lives as comics and creators, and often tap into how the \"unemployable\" mentality leaves room for major opportunities outside of sitting at a desk for 8 hours a day.\n\nWhether you've got your daily commute, a long flight or the treadmill cranked up to 15, The Unemployables Podcast is ready for you to inappropriately laugh for an hour each week. Enjoy, you sex machine, you.\n\nSpecial thanks to the producers at Pro-Ject, who make this entire podcast possible, and our video crew, We Are A Team, for all the crispy footage.",

            "description": "COVID-19 is changing the way we live. We face the urgent challenges of combating the virus and getting people back to work. Once this crisis phase has passed - and under the shadow of its possible return - we must rebuild our economies, reintegrate all aspects of society, and reshape policy and practice around the world to be more resilient against global threats.\n<br><br>\nIn Reimagine, former Google CEO and co-founder of Schmidt Futures Eric Schmidt will engage in conversations with the world's leaders in government, business, science, and technology to reimagine the future of society after COVID-19.  Eric will draw upon his expertise as a global business leader, scientist, and philanthropist to explore how we can mobilize people and technology to solve our current challenges at scale and to build a brighter future after this global crisis.  Each conversation will probe a local, national, or global facet of COVID-19 and some will feature a call to action for listeners or a prize competition for the best ideas related to the insights of the episode.",
